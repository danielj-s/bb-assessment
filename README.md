# Baltimore Banner Assessment

To run the app, `npm i` then `npm run dev`.

There's no .nvmrc but it installs and runs fine in Node 16, 18, or 20.
I added comments in the code where improvements would need to be made if this were ever headed to production. In addition to what I mention in those comments, other omissions I'd correct include error handling, some loading states, and unit tests.
